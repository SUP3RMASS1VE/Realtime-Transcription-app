# 🎙️ Real-Time Transcription with FastRTC

A real-time speech-to-text web app using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [FastRTC](https://github.com/sofi444/fastrtc). This project allows users to stream or upload audio for fast and accurate transcription directly in the browser.

🔗 **Live Code**: [SUP3RMASS1VE/realtime-transcription-fastrtc](https://github.com/SUP3RMASS1VE/realtime-transcription-fastrtc)

> ⚡️ _This is a modified fork of [sofi444/realtime-transcription-fastrtc](https://github.com/sofi444/realtime-transcription-fastrtc). Huge thanks to them for their incredible foundational work!_

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Real-time audio streaming** via WebRTC
- 📝 **Live transcription** using OpenAI's Whisper model
- 📂 **File upload support** for audio transcription
- ⚙️ **Device-aware optimization** (CPU/GPU support, FlashAttention 2 when available)
- 🌐 **Simple and clean web UI** with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)
- 🚀 **FastAPI backend** with `/upload-audio`, `/transcript`, and root routes

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A supported CUDA GPU (for optimal performance, optional)
- `ffmpeg` installed and available in your `PATH`

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SUP3RMASS1VE/realtime-transcription-fastrtc.git
cd realtime-transcription-fastrtc

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

- Visit `http://localhost:7860` to access the web interface.
- Stream audio or upload an audio file to see transcriptions in real time.

---

## 🧠 Model Info

By default, the app uses:

```
openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo
```

You can override the model by setting the `MODEL_ID` environment variable:

```bash
export MODEL_ID="openai/whisper-small"
```

---

## 📡 Endpoints

- `GET /` — Web UI
- `POST /upload-audio` — Upload audio file for transcription
- `GET /transcript?webrtc_id=...` — Stream transcript events for WebRTC clients

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- FastRTC handles low-latency audio streaming via WebRTC
- Audio is processed using Silero VAD and chunked for transcription
- Whisper (via `transformers` pipeline) performs transcription
- Transcripts are streamed back in real-time or returned on file upload
